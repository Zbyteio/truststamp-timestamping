# Truststamp Timestamping

Welcome to the Truststamp Timestamping project! This repository contains the implementation of a blockchain-based timestamping service that leverages the power of the zbyte platform. The service is designed to provide secure, verifiable, and immutable timestamps for files and data, ensuring their integrity and authenticity.

## Overview

The Truststamp Timestamping service allows users to hash their files and data, store these hashes on the blockchain, and retrieve them for verification purposes. This ensures that the integrity and authenticity of the files and data can be independently verified at any point in the future.

## Features

- **Blockchain-Based Timestamps**: Provides immutable timestamps for files and data.
- **File Hashing**: Generates cryptographic hashes for files and data.
- **Secure Storage**: Stores hashes on the blockchain for secure and tamper-proof records.
- **Verification**: Allows retrieval and verification of file hashes against blockchain records.
- **Integration with zbyte Platform**: Leverages zbyte's blockchain infrastructure for reliability and scalability.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
- A GitHub account with access to the repositories you want to timestamp.
- AWS S3 or Firebase account for storing files.
